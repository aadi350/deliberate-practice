# Deliberate Practice
*The foundations of this constitute a 3-month plan in preparation for interviews, and follow Jeff-Li's structure and four main areas of what an ideal data scientist should be able to do*  
## Technical 
> Is able to apply advanced techniques/concepts to multiple problems whilst writing elegant re-producable code, including their own packages

## Independent 
> Is paired with a Junior DS to mentor, with strong knowledge of multiple areas and captures synergies between the business

## Problem Formulation
> Develops the project roadmap to hit goals set by executive teams

## Influence 
> Partners with Project Managers on areas of expertise, is able to work to contribute to the project roadmap

# Current Assessment 
In order to move forward, I need to perform gap analysis on my current skills, moving forward quickly and iterating on each of the above four. I will find my weakest areas, which will allow me to develop a plan that fills these gaps 

Each area has points with areas for improvement, and "drills" designed to improve the given area.

### Technical Skills
| Area for Improvement | Drill |
| --- | --- | 
| My code is slow, especially for parameter optimization | | 

### Influence
| Area for Improvement | Drill |
| --- | --- |
| I have no clue about my current field | Read/make notes about credit risk modeling 1h every day |

### Problem Formulation
| Area for Improvement | Drill |
| --- | --- |
| | |

### Independence
| Area for Improvement | Drill |
| --- | --- |
| I don't know how to correspond to flesh out information from business partners | |


## Framework
*Focus, Feedback, Fix it*
1. Set a specific goal with a constrained time-limit
2. Define a clear metric to measure improvement
3. Modify efforts in response to feedback
4. Build and modify mental representations

## Questions for more deliberate practice
1. Do I understand the fundamentals?
2. Am I working on the next step?
3. What am I missing?

## Sample Plan
1. Find a data scientist/company that I respect
2. Break their analysis process up into pieces that I want to improve (e.g. if I want to work on problem formulation, take note of the processes used to extract a well-worded problem used by the company)
3. Identify pieces of my analysis that are less strong, and create exercises to improve these elements
4. Iterate
   
## Topics Planning 
| Topic | Time | Metric to Measure | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Imbalanced Data Classification | 2 Weeks | *TBD* |
